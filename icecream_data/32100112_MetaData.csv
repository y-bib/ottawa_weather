"Note ID",Note
1,"Prior to January 1988, data for Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island were excluded from Canada totals to avoid disclosure of individual plant operations. Commencing January 1988, an increase in the number of respondents has allowed Canada totals to include both Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island as "other provinces". New Brunswick is included in "other provinces" as of January 1989 and Nova Scotia as of July 1991."
2,"Data include both creamed and uncreamed cottage cheese."
3,"Pizza cheese also composed of partly-skimmed mozzarella."
4,"Some data suppressions have been removed. There was no impact on the data."
5,"Starting January 2012, volumes of fruit and/or additives are excluded."
6,"Data for "Cheddar cheese" for Canada and Quebec were corrected for August 2011."
